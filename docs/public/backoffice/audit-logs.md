# Audit Logs

Every AI operation (chat completion, embedding generation) is logged with detailed information about the request, response, timing, and outcome. Use audit logs for monitoring, debugging, and compliance.

## Accessing Audit Logs

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Expand **AI**
3. Click **Audit Logs**

## Understanding the Log List

The log list shows recent AI operations:

| Column     | Description                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Time       | When the operation started            |
| Status     | Outcome (Succeeded, Failed, etc.)     |
| Capability | Type of operation (Chat, Embedding)   |
| Profile    | Which profile was used                |
| Provider   | AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) |
| Model      | Specific model used                   |
| User       | Who initiated the operation           |
| Tokens     | Total tokens used                     |
| Duration   | How long the operation took           |

## Filtering Logs

Use the filter options to narrow results:

| Filter     | Description              |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Date Range | From and To dates        |
| Status     | Success, Failed, Running |
| Capability | Chat, Embedding          |
| Profile    | Specific profile         |
| Provider   | Specific provider        |
| User       | Specific user            |

### Example Filters

- **Failed operations today**: Status = Failed, Date = Today
- **High token usage**: Sort by Tokens descending
- **Specific user activity**: User = john@example.com

## Viewing Log Details

Click a log entry to view full details:

### Summary

- Start time, end time, duration
- Status and any error information
- User who initiated the operation

### AI Configuration

- Profile used (with version)
- Provider and model
- Feature type (prompt, agent, or direct)

### Token Usage

- Input tokens (request)
- Output tokens (response)
- Total tokens

### Content (if captured)

Depending on the configuration:

- **Prompt snapshot** - The actual request sent (if `PersistPrompts` is enabled)
- **Response snapshot** - The AI's response (if `PersistResponses` is enabled)

{% hint style="info" %}
Content snapshots are controlled by the `PersistPrompts` and `PersistResponses` configuration options. Both default to true.
{% endhint %}

## Status Values

| Status             | Description                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| **Succeeded**      | Operation completed successfully  |
| **Failed**         | Operation encountered an error    |
| **Running**        | Operation is in progress          |
| **Cancelled**      | Operation was cancelled           |
| **PartialSuccess** | Some parts succeeded, some failed |

## Error Categories

When operations fail, the error category helps diagnose the issue:

| Category       | Description            | Typical Cause                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Authentication | Credential issues      | Invalid or expired API key      |
| RateLimit      | Too many requests      | Provider rate limit exceeded    |
| Timeout        | Request timed out      | Slow response or network issues |
| InvalidRequest | Bad request format     | Invalid parameters or content   |
| ModelError     | Model processing error | Content policy violation        |
| NetworkError   | Connection issues      | Network connectivity            |

## Deleting Logs

To delete a specific log:

1. Select the log entry
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting audit logs is permanent. Consider your compliance requirements before deletion.
{% endhint %}

## Cleanup

To remove old logs:

1. Click **Cleanup** in the toolbar
2. Specify how old logs should be (e.g., 90 days)
3. Confirm the cleanup

### Automatic Cleanup

Configure automatic cleanup in `appsettings.json`:

{% code title="appsettings.json" %}

```json
{
    "Umbraco": {
        "AI": {
            "AuditLog": {
                "RetentionDays": 90,
                "AutoCleanupEnabled": true,
                "AutoCleanupIntervalHours": 24
            }
        }
    }
}
```

{% endcode %}

## Use Cases

### Debugging Failed Operations

1. Filter by Status = Failed
2. Review error category and message
3. Check the prompt snapshot for issues
4. Identify patterns (time, user, profile)

### Monitoring Usage

1. View recent logs to see activity
2. Check token usage trends
3. Identify heavy users or operations

### Compliance Auditing

1. Filter by date range for the audit period
2. Export or document the relevant logs
3. Include user, timestamp, and operation details
