# Managing Connections

Connections store the credentials needed to communicate with AI providers. Manage them through the backoffice UI.

## Viewing Connections

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **AI** > **Connections**
2. The connection list shows all configured connections
3. Click a connection to view or edit its details

## Creating a Connection

1. Click **Create Connection** in the Connections section
2. Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name for the connection |
| **Alias** | Unique identifier (used in code) |
| **Provider** | Select from installed providers |

3. Configure provider-specific settings (varies by provider)
4. Click **Save**

### OpenAI Provider Settings

When using the OpenAI provider:

| Setting | Description | Required |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **API Key** | Your OpenAI API key | Yes |
| **Organization** | Organization ID (if applicable) | No |

## Using Configuration References

Instead of storing API keys directly in the database, use configuration references:

1. Add your API key to `appsettings.json`:

{% code title="appsettings.json" %}
```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "sk-your-api-key-here"
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

2. In the connection settings, enter `$OpenAI:ApiKey` as the API Key value

The `$` prefix tells Umbraco.Ai to resolve the value from configuration at runtime.

{% hint style="success" %}
Configuration references keep sensitive values out of the database and allow different values per environment.
{% endhint %}

## Editing a Connection

1. Click on the connection in the list
2. Modify the desired fields
3. Click **Save**

{% hint style="warning" %}
Changing a connection's provider is not supported. Create a new connection instead.
{% endhint %}

## Deleting a Connection

1. Open the connection you want to delete
2. Click **Delete** in the actions menu
3. Confirm the deletion

{% hint style="danger" %}
Deleting a connection will break any profiles that depend on it. Consider deactivating the connection instead.
{% endhint %}

## Enabling and Disabling Connections

Use the **Active** toggle to enable or disable a connection:

* **Active** - Connection is available for use
* **Inactive** - Connection is disabled; profiles using it will fail

This is useful for:
* Temporarily disabling a connection without deleting it
* Rotating API keys (create new connection, disable old one)
* Testing failover scenarios

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names** - "OpenAI Production" is better than "Connection 1"
2. **Use configuration references** - Keep API keys out of the database
3. **Create separate connections per environment** - Don't share production keys in development
4. **Use meaningful aliases** - They're used in code and should be readable
