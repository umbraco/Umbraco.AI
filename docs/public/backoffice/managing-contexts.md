# Managing Contexts

AI Contexts allow you to define reusable content collections like brand voice guidelines, terminology, and reference materials that get injected into AI operations.

## Accessing Contexts

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar
2. Expand **AI**
3. Click **Contexts**

## Creating a Context

1. Click **Create Context** in the toolbar
2. Fill in the required fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Alias | Unique identifier for code references (URL-safe, no spaces) |
| Name | Display name shown in the backoffice |

3. Click **Create**

## Adding Resources

Contexts contain one or more resources. Each resource represents a piece of content to inject:

1. In the context editor, click **Add Resource**
2. Configure the resource:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Type | The type of resource (e.g., Text) |
| Name | Display name for organization |
| Description | Optional description |
| Content | The actual content to inject |
| Injection Mode | When to inject: Always or On Demand |

3. Click **Add**

### Resource Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Text** | Plain text content like guidelines or terminology |
| **Document** | Structured content with metadata |

### Reordering Resources

Resources are injected in order. To reorder:

1. Drag resources using the handle on the left
2. Or use the arrow buttons to move resources up/down

Resources at the top are injected first.

## Editing a Context

1. Select the context from the list
2. Modify fields as needed
3. Add, edit, or remove resources
4. Click **Save**

{% hint style="info" %}
Every save creates a new version. You can view and rollback to previous versions.
{% endhint %}

## Deleting a Context

1. Select the context from the list
2. Click **Delete** in the toolbar
3. Confirm the deletion

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a context also removes all version history. Consider whether any prompts or agents reference this context before deletion.
{% endhint %}

## Example: Brand Voice Context

A typical brand voice context might include:

**Name**: Brand Voice Guidelines

**Resources**:

1. **Tone of Voice** (Always)
   ```
   Our brand voice is:
   - Friendly and approachable
   - Professional but not stuffy
   - Clear and jargon-free
   - Empowering and positive
   ```

2. **Writing Style** (Always)
   ```
   Writing guidelines:
   - Use active voice
   - Keep sentences short
   - Address the reader as "you"
   - Avoid technical jargon
   ```

3. **Terminology** (Always)
   ```
   Preferred terms:
   - Use "customers" not "users"
   - Use "help" not "assist"
   - Use "simple" not "easy"
   ```

## Using Contexts

Contexts are used by:

- **Prompts** - Associate contexts to inject guidelines
- **Agents** - Include context in agent instructions
- **Profiles** - System prompts can reference context content

### Associating with a Prompt

When editing a prompt:

1. Expand the **Contexts** section
2. Click **Add Context**
3. Select the context(s) to include
4. Save the prompt
