# Analytics API

The Analytics API provides aggregated usage statistics derived from audit logs. Use these endpoints to understand AI usage patterns, costs, and performance across your application.

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | [`/analytics/summary`](summary.md) | Get usage summary for a period |
| GET | [`/analytics/timeseries`](timeseries.md) | Get usage over time |
| GET | [`/analytics/breakdown/provider`](breakdown-provider.md) | Usage breakdown by provider |
| GET | [`/analytics/breakdown/model`](breakdown-model.md) | Usage breakdown by model |
| GET | [`/analytics/breakdown/profile`](breakdown-profile.md) | Usage breakdown by profile |
| GET | [`/analytics/breakdown/user`](breakdown-user.md) | Usage breakdown by user |

## Base URL

```
/umbraco/ai/management/api/v1
```

## Common Query Parameters

All analytics endpoints support these parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `from` | datetime | Yes | Start of period (inclusive) |
| `to` | datetime | Yes | End of period (inclusive) |
| `granularity` | string | No | Data granularity: `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month` |

## Analytics Concepts

### Summary Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `totalRequests` | Number of AI operations |
| `inputTokens` | Total tokens in requests |
| `outputTokens` | Total tokens in responses |
| `totalTokens` | Combined token count |
| `successCount` | Successful operations |
| `failureCount` | Failed operations |
| `successRate` | Success percentage (0.0-1.0) |
| `averageDurationMs` | Mean operation time in milliseconds |

### Time Series

Time series data shows metrics over time, useful for trend analysis and identifying usage patterns.

### Breakdowns

Breakdowns show how usage is distributed across different dimensions:

- **By Provider** - Which AI providers are used most
- **By Model** - Which models consume most tokens
- **By Profile** - Which profiles are most active
- **By User** - Who uses AI features most

## Example: Dashboard Query

To populate a usage dashboard, you might call multiple endpoints:

{% code title="C#" %}
```csharp
var from = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-30);
var to = DateTime.UtcNow;
var query = $"from={from:O}&to={to:O}";

// Get overall summary
var summary = await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<AIUsageSummary>(
    $"/umbraco/ai/management/api/v1/analytics/summary?{query}");

// Get daily time series
var timeSeries = await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<AIUsageTimeSeriesPoint>>(
    $"/umbraco/ai/management/api/v1/analytics/timeseries?{query}&granularity=day");

// Get provider breakdown
var byProvider = await httpClient.GetFromJsonAsync<List<AIUsageBreakdownItem>>(
    $"/umbraco/ai/management/api/v1/analytics/breakdown/provider?{query}");
```
{% endcode %}
