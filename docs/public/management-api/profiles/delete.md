  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
{% endcode %}

### Delete by Alias

{% code title="cURL" %}
```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://your-site.com/umbraco/ai/management/api/v1/profile/content-assistant" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Deleting a profile is permanent and cannot be undone. Any code referencing the deleted profile's alias will fail.
{% endhint %}

## Considerations

### Before Deleting

1. **Check usage** - Ensure no application code references the profile by alias
2. **Update configurations** - Remove profile references from any configurations
3. **Consider deactivation** - If unsure, consider creating a replacement profile first

### After Deleting

- The profile ID and alias become available for reuse
- Any AI requests using the deleted profile will fail
- Historical data referencing the profile may show the ID but no details
